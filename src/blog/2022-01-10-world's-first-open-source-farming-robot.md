## The Engineer(s) Behind [**FarmBot**](https://farm.bot)

The idea came from a graduate student who was beginning his studies in mechanical engineering together with organic agriculture at 22 years old.

## How it works on the farm

As the inventor says, the technology _"is like a big 3D printer, but for the plants"_

1. FarmBot Parts - the brains & the movable joints.

   </p>

   The technology is composed of a Raspberry Pi computer about little $30 computer and that's the brain of farm bot, and then the a microcontroller the Arduino, both ramped in a protective shield, to protect the electronics from the environmental factors; and then the stepper motors which allow it to move in the three dimensions; and then on the back is a rotary encoders, which allows farm bot to know if something goes wrong route tracks for ease of movement, gantry that's which is connected to a magnetic tool head that can pick up these tools: seed injector, soil sensor, and watering nozzle for watering the plants too. These models are available for anyone who would like to print them out. You can check out the hardware components [here](https://farm.bot/pages/hardware)

2. User Interface & Web Application

   </p>

   The hardware parts of the technology allows interaction from anywhere in the world with the use of their remote web application built on a dynamically typed language (scripting language) known as Ruby and they used the Ruby on Rails framework. The best part of it is that the code is Open source for the anyone to fork on GitHub and use them and distribute it as it is or in any modified form as stated in their license. You can easily graphically design your farm by dragging and dropping plants into the map. The game-like interface is learned in just a few minutes so youâ€™ll have the whole growing season planned in no time. Their is also software documentation available for users. You can also check out information on the software [here](https://farm.bot/pages/software)

## How to get the FarmBot

As said earlier the project is fully open source and anyone can use it as they wish to improve the underlying technology and add other implementations. To get this product one can:

1.  DIY (Do It Yourself)

    You can decide and download all the print models and buy them because all of the materials required are readily available including the aluminium structures except from the 3D printed models which you'll have to acquire a 3D printer to produce them. The 3D printer together with the other materials required will cost you upto USD 1000, _which is KES 113400 as of today's Kenya's currency market_, as the owner stated in an interview. The setup can be done in under an hour and you are good to go. Check out the acquisitions [here](https://farm.bot/collections)
